::: tip
You can set days at maximum of 7 days, limitation from discord.
:::

::: tip Why can't the bot ban a member?
It could be, that your bot role, is below the member role! 

Discord prevents users (members/bots) from banning members above their highest role
:::

::: danger Be really careful with adding this to a command!
EVERY member that can execute the command that this function is added in will be able to BAN everyone below the bot role!

We highly suggest, not putting the bot role above "Admin" and "head moderator"
