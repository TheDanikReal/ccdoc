# Creating a Custom Command

Starting with our Bot could be a nightmare without any guidelines. 

But not with this guide! We will show, you what each setting does, and how to use it!


## Create a new command
Before we start working on our command, we have to create one.

1. Lets go where all commands are born, the [dashboard](https://ccommandbot.com/dashboard)!

2. Select the desired server to work in

4. Press the **Create** Button

::: tip Tour
On your first visit you will be greeted with a dashboard tour!
We highly suggest NOT skipping through it. It will save you a lot of trouble in the future!
:::

## Type
The very first part of every command is it's type, an action which will activate your command.
It can be selected using this dropdown menu:
> ![Type dropdown](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/957286111250624552/1096882428422918164/image.png)

| Trigger Type | Triggers when|
| --------                                      | -------- |

| [Slash Commands](../Trigger/slash.md)         | Someone uses bot's slash command|

| [Channel Create/Delete](../Trigger/channel.md)| A channel is created/deleted|
| [Library](../Trigger/library.md)| Create A library|

As shown above, our bot supports a lot of events! And we're constantly adding more!

::: tip Hint
You can proceed to a guide on specific trigger by clicking the green name of it.

## Trigger
Command type is sometimes not enough to make your command work perfectly. 
Sometimes you need the action to meet some conditions, for example: a message should start with `!ping` to activate your **ping** command.
This field can be specified using this input field:
> ![trigger input](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/957286111250624552/1096884667686326302/image.png)
::: tip
The value expected greatly depends on the type of your command. We recommend checking documentation of your desired type to know what you can put in this field.

## Code
Now as you know how to make a trigger, we can move on to the real **meat** of a custom command, the **code**.
Code is simply what the bot will do upon triggering.
It can be set using this field:
> ![code editor](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/957286111250624552/1096900826791944304/image.png)

### What should I put there?
The simplest code is just a text which gets sent after triggering.
But typing in a plain text is of course not all you can do with CC.
Inside the code field you can use various functions, which you can find under the `Functions` tab in this documentation, or in docs built into the dashboard.

::: tip Examples
You can find some examples of CC in action in the [Tutorials & Examples](../Tutorials/1.ping.md) tab.

::: tip Save
Remember to always click the save button after making changes to your command!

## Templates
You do not always have to code every single command by yourself. From the dashboard you get access to a great deal of templates, that can be effortlessly imported and setup easily.
