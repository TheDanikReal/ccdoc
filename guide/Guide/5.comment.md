# Adding code comments

## Introduction
Comments are parts of the code that don't get executed. 

### Why do I need comments?
Comments come in handy in a few situations:
* **Annotating** -  they can describe what a specific part of the code does
* **Testing** - you can temporarily disable a single section to test a different part
* **Documenting** - comments can act as a code documentation e.g explain custom functions

With our syntax it's pretty easy to add comments:
```
// Single line comment 

/* Multi
Line
Comment
*/
```

## Single line Comment
A single line comment can be achieved by placing two forward slashes at the beginning of a line:
### Code 
Let's code something and describe it with a short comment
```bash
// this part sums 2 numbers
$let[num1;5]
$let[num2;10]
Result is $sum[$num1;$num2]
```

### Output
Now it's time to check if the comment worked fine
<discord-messages>
    <discord-message :bot="true" author="Custom Command" role-color="#0099ff" avatar="https://media.discordapp.net/avatars/725721249652670555/781224f90c3b841ba5b40678e032f74a.webp">
        Result is 15
    </discord-message>
</discord-messages>

As you see the comment at line 1 didn't appear in the result

## Multiple Lines Comment
In some cases you may want to comment out more than one line or a specific part of it.
You can do that by wrapping the comment with a combination of slashes and asterisks: `/* Comment */`

### Code 
Let's extend our previous comment with some extra lines:

```bash
/* This part
Sums two numbers
num1 and num2
and it send the result 
*/
$let[num1;5]
$let[num2;10]
result is $sum[$num1;$num2]
```

### Output
Here's what the bot returns: 

<discord-messages>
    <discord-message :bot="true" author="Custom Command" role-color="#0099ff" avatar="https://media.discordapp.net/avatars/725721249652670555/781224f90c3b841ba5b40678e032f74a.webp">
        Result is 15
    </discord-message>
</discord-messages>

As you can see it didn't add any extra content despite adding more lines.
