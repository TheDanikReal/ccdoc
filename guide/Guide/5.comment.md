# How to add comment in your codes

## Introduction
comments can be used to explain the code, and to make it more readable for yourself and others.

comments can also be used to skip execution of certain parts, when testing codes.

In our syntax it's pretty easy to add comments
```
// Single Line Comment
/* Multiple
Lines
Comments
*/
```

## Example 1: Using Single line Comment
### Code 
```bash
// this part sums 2 numbers
$let[num1;5]
$let[num2;10]
result is $sum[$num1;$num2]
```

### Output

> as you see the comment at line 1 didn't appear in the result

## Example 2: Using Multiple Lines Comment
### Code 
```bash
/* This part
Sums two numbers
num1 and num2
and it send the result 
*/
$let[num1;5]
$let[num2;10]
result is $sum[$num1;$num2]
```
