## Why does the bot have such high cooldowns?
::: details Answer

But sadly we aren't quite big enough yet to get our rateimits decreased. 
Regarding to this, we sadly have to add cooldowns to functions and command executions. This to prevent a punishment from Discord Inc.

## Are there inbuilt commands, or do I have to code them all myself?
:::details Answer
You kind of need to. We only have some basic commands like `!!purge` and `!!ban` built in. You can view them all by running `!!commands` in your server. 

Other commands that you can use include getting a dashboard link or your total amount of votes. Read [me](../Guide/botInfo.md) to learn more
